    "I've been working with (and often against) webhooks for years, both as a
    consumer and an implementer, always wishing that we as an industry could
    come up with something better. In my opinion, Event Destinations are exactly
    that."

    "Webhooks are a great idea, suffering from a bad implementation. Event
    Destinations is an incredible project to move the industry forward with a
    consumer experience that works for developers, rather than against them."

    "For years, I've been thinking about the evolution of webhooks. Why create
    them, verify them, manage and scale them? Why can't companies directly send
    information into brokers? We can simplify the whole thing, and event
    destinations may be the next step forward. EDA is becoming more accessible
    for everyone, so why not make handling real-time events easier, too?"

    "Delivering webhooks at scale is hard. Event Destinations represents a
    required evolution of event delivery, helping event producers scale more
    efficiently and providing a much improved developer experience for event
    consumers."
