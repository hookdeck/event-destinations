<h2 class="bold-m">A decade of webhooks: Progress with limits</h2>
<p class="muted">
  Over the last 10 years, webhooks have become the go-to mechanism for
  delivering events from developer platforms to support other platform
  integrations, custom integrations, and workflows. Webhooks have been
  transformative and offer wide compatibility but come with well-known issues:

</ul>
<p class="muted">
  Webhooks are the least common denominator. They offer amazing reach but are
  less capable. How can you combine the reach of webhooks with the capabilities
  of other event paradigms? With Event Destinations.

<h2 class="bold-m">Reimagining event delivery</h2>
<p class="muted">
  Best practices today often dictate validating and queuing webhooks via a
  message bus upon receipt. This raises a fundamental question: Why depend on
  inefficient public HTTP endpoints? Why not send events directly to secure and
  efficient event destinations?
</p>

</div>
<h2 class="bold-m">The emergence of event destinations</h2>
<p class="muted">
  Pioneers in the industry are shifting away from traditional webhooks toward a
  more versatile model. For example, Stripe’s Event Destinations allow
  developers to select the best destination for their needs—webhooks are just
  one of a few options. This shift brings clear advantages.

<h2 class="bold-m">Better developer experience for all</h2>
<p class="muted">
  At the core of this shift is a commitment to enhancing the developer
  experience. Platforms can improve the developer experience by expanding
  platform event delivery options and capabilities, moving beyond only offering
  traditional webhooks by supporting Event Destinations such as AWS SQS, GCP
  PubSub, Hookdeck, RabbitMQ, and Kafka, to name a few.
</p>
<p class="muted">
  This DX evolution helps everyone; developers gain tools that are more powerful
  and simpler to use and maintain. Developers are, therefore, more successful
  and faster at adopting developer platforms.

  This evolution isn’t just about solving pain points – it’s about unlocking new
  possibilities for developers building event-driven applications. By
  prioritizing interoperability, security, and efficiency, Event Destinations
  represent the next step in creating a developer experience that empowers
  everyone.
</p>
<h2 class="bold-m">The vision</h2>
<p class="muted">
  Webhooks have brought us to where we are today and will undoubtedly remain a
  cornerstone of event interoperability for the foreseeable future. However, as
  the industry evolves, the path forward lies in progressively adopting
  interoperable, secure, and efficient Event Destinations.
</p>
<p class="muted">
  By enhancing existing webhook capabilities while introducing new destination
  types, developers can transition at their own pace, maintain backward
  compatibility and leverage the best of both worlds.
</p>
<p class="muted">
  This incremental approach ensures continuity while enabling innovation,
  simplifying event-driven architectures, and creating better developer
  experiences for everyone.
